# Airlines-Airports-EDA-Regression

Full Anaylsis of all domestic US flights, incl Airlines and Airports for 2018/2019. Summary/conclusions found here: https://tinyurl.com/y5y6xcpn

#### Questions I seek to answer:
  1. Busiest days of the week? Busiest months of the year?
  2. Average departure/arrival delays during the year
  3. Correlation betweent departure and arrival delays
  4. Do planes fly faster when there is a depature delay to make up for lost time?
  5. The rates of delay during a 24hr period
  6. Most common type of delays and cancellations
  7. Busiest airlines? Highest delay/cancellation rates amongst airlines?
  8. Average delay times between airlines
  9. Fastest airspeeds between airlines
  10. Busiest airports? Highest delay/cancellation amongst airport
  11. Different causes of delays/cancellations between airports
  12. Fuel Efficiency amongst airlines
  13. Finding factors that effect fuel efficiency

#### Using machine learning to predict arrival delay (Regression)
Given only variables that we would know before a certain flight takes off, can we predict the arrival delay? Feature engineering, feature correlation/importance etc... Utilizes ensemble learning (Random Forest, Decision trees) and XGBoost

#### Using machine learning to predict flight cancellations (Binary Classification)
Given only variables that we would know before a certain flight takes off, can we predict whether a flight would be cancelled or not?  Utilizes ensemble learning (Random Forest, Decision trees) and XGBoost
